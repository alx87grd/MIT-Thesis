	abstract = {This paper presents a systematic methodology for on-site identification and energy-optimal path planning of an industrial robot. The identification experiments are carried out on-site, in a quick, non-invasive way using a CA8335 Qualistar three-phase electrical networks analyser. Next, the collected data is compared with a parametrised dynamic robot model in an optimisation routine. This routine results in the specification of a parametric dynamic robot model. The model is used as a dynamic constraint for a model predictive control problem, where other physical constraints are added i.e. the limited workspace and the constraints on the joint velocities and accelerations. A sequential quadratic programming solver is used to minimise a mechanical energy based cost function. The resulting energy-optimal path is translated into custom robot commands executable on an industrial robot. The systematic methodology is validated on an IRB1600 industrial ABB robot performing a custom pick-and- place operation. The obtained dynamic robot model is given and compared to the collected measurements. To demonstrate the possibility of energy saving by ‘intelligently’ programming a robot trajectory the energy and time-optimal paths are generated taking all physical constraints into account. Simulation results show a significant time and energy improvement (up to 5\%) compared to most trajectories generated by the ABB software. The most remarkable result is that the fastest energy-optimal trajectory turns out to be 4\% more energy efficient and 3\% faster then the commercially available fastest trajectory. Additional stand-still experiments show that activation of the brakes is favoured over an actuated stand-still from an energy point of view, assuming that the start-up time when releasing the brakes is limited.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the actuator with adjustable stiffness (AwAS-II), an enhanced version of the original realization AwAS. This new variable stiffness actuator significantly differs from its predecessor on the mechanism used for the stiffness regulation. While AwAS tunes the stiffness by regulating the position of the compliant elements along the lever arm, AwAS-II changes the position of the lever's pivot point. As a result of the new principle, AwAS-II can change the stiffness in a much broader range (from zero to infinity) even by using softer springs and shorter lever arm, compared to AwAS. This makes the setup of AwAS-II more compact and lighter and improves the stiffness regulation response. To evaluate the aptitude of the fast stiffness adjustment, experiments on reproducing the stiffness profile of the human ankle during the stance phase of a normal walking gait are conducted. Results indicate that AwAS-II is capable of reproducing an interpolated stiffness profile of the ankle while providing a net positive work and thus a sufficient amount of energy as required for the toe-off.},

The backdrivability is important and necessary for robots that operate around our life space to guarantee the safety of us, themselves and environments. A rotational actuator with a high reduction ratio reducer has been commonly used in traditional robotics field, but it cannot realize the high-backdrivability without any sensory feedback. In this study, several high-backdrivable shaft actuators are used instead of it. Moreover, the CVT mechanism which is brought by a novel configuration of the parallel mechanism is employed effectively. To utilize multiple shaft actuators with the CVT mechanism is able to surmount a drawback of the shaft actuator whose output force is relatively weak. A simple 1 DOF manipulator is proposed as the first step of this study. Firstly, its kinematic and dynamic models are given. Next, a PD type feedback control signal to regulate the arm's angle and the CVT simultaneously is designed. A static relation between an output end-point force and the CVT mechanism is analyzed. Finally, several fundamental experiments are conducted to show the effectiveness of proposed mechanism.},

X-screw has a transmission ratio that automatically changes in response to the load, making it possible to combine relatively high speed motion under low loads with a large maximum load capacity in a much smaller space and with less complexity, than traditional transmission systems. X-screw also has built-in overload protection since it will stop advancing if the load exceeds a certain value although the motor is able to continue to rotate. Furthermore, X-screw can produce arbitrarily slow linear motion from a high speed input, eliminating the need for bulky gear reductions.

	abstract = {A nonlinear feedback scheme for a gravity-assisted underactuated manipulator with second-order nonholonomic constraints is presented in this paper. The joints of the hyper articulated arm have no dedicated actuators but are activated by gravity. By tilting the base link appropriately, the gravitational torque drives the unactuated links to a desired angular position. With simple locking mechanisms, the hyperarticulated arm can change its configuration using only one actuator at the base. This underactuated arm design was motivated by the need for a compact snake-like robot that can go into aircraft wings and perform assembly operations using heavy end-effectors. The dynamics of the unactuated links are essentially second-order nonholonomic constraints for which there are no general methods to design closed-loop control. We propose a nonlinear closed-loop control law that is guaranteed to be stable in positioning one unactuated joint at a time. We synthesize a Lyapunov function to prove the convergence of this control scheme. The Lyapunov function also generates estimates of the domain of convergence of the control law for various control gains. The control algorithm is implemented on a prototype three-link system. Finally, we provide some experimental results to demonstrate the efficacy of the control scheme.},

Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL) can hold objects, clamp them to a fixture, guide and support human hands, and assist the wearer in performing a task as a close co-worker. This paper focuses on a class of tasks where SRL physically interacts with the environment through contact. SRL makes contact with a wall and thereby braces the human body against the environment. SRL also guides the human hands by placing a drill jig over the drilling location. Bracing the human body and guiding the hands, SRL can enhance the drilling task stability and accuracy. The SRL technology is applied to aircraft assembly, where conventional industrial robots failed to perform effectively. First, the basic design concept of SRL is summarized, and task strategies using SRL and their functional requirements are described. Kinematic and static properties resulting from the structural closed loops formed around the SRL, the human, and the environment are analyzed, and effective strategies for physical disturbance rejection and fine positioning are discussed. A prototype robotic arm grasps the aircraft fuselage structure. Another robotic arm places a drill jig precisely on the fuselage structure, and guides and stabilizes a hand drill held by the human user. An optimization method is developed in order to identify the SRL kinematic configuration and joint torques that stabilize the drill and at the same time minimize the human workload.},

	abstract = {A wearable robot secured on the shoulder of a human is developed for assisting its wearer in the execution of tasks in the overhead workspace. Installing a ceiling panel is an example of such a task. During this task the robot can hold the panel or collaborate actively with the human in order to fix the panel with the appropriate equipment. This wearable robot, termed "Supernumerary Robotic Limbs", works closely with the human to streamline the operation and reduce the human workload. First, the design concept of the Robot-on-the-Shoulder system is described, and a new approach to the coordinated control between the wearable robot and the human is presented. A graphical task process representation based on Coloured Petri Nets (CPN) is used to model the concurrent and distributed nature of the human-robot system, which comprises two human hands and two robot hands. The CPN framework is then extended to a type of hybrid control system by imbedding local dynamic controllers in the Transition nodes of the CPN model. Each local dynamic controller collects sensor signals relevant to the target transition and makes a predictive control decision. This allows the robot on the shoulder to take a proactive and preemptive action as well as to confirm a successful Transition. The control parameters for these algorithms are tuned based on "teaching-by-showing" techniques using human demonstration data. Partial Least Squares is used for extracting significant sensor signals from high-dimensional sensor data in order to do real time predictions and control. A prototype robot-on-the-shoulder system is built, and the CPN hybrid control is implemented and tested for a ceiling panel installation task.},

	abstract = {This paper presents the development of a normal adjustment cell (NAC) in aero-robotic drilling to improve the quality of vertical drilling, by using an intelligent double-eccentric disk normal adjustment mechanism (2-EDNA), a spherical plain bearing and a floating compress module with sensors. After the surface normal vector is calculated based on the laser sensors’ feedback, the 2-EDNA concept is conceived specifically to address the deviation of the spindle from the surface normal at the drilling point. Following the angle calculation, depending on the actual initial position, two precise eccentric disks (PEDs) with an identical eccentric radius are used to rotate with the appropriate angles using two high-resolution DC servomotors. The two PEDs will carry the spindle to coincide with the surface normal, keeping the vertex of the drill bit still to avoid repeated adjustment and position compensation. A series of experiments was conducted on an aeronautical drilling robot platform with a precise NAC. The effect of normal adjustment on bore diameter, drilling force, burr size, drilling heat, and tool wear was analyzed. The results validate that using the NAC in robotic drilling results in greatly improved vertical drilling quality and is attainable in terms of intelligence and accuracy.},

The technology is exemplified on a soft robot intended for MRI-guided prostate interventions. DEs are chosen for their major advantages of softness, high strains, low cost, and embedded multiple-DOF sensing capability, providing excellent system integration. A geometrical model of the proposed DE sensor is developed and compared to experimental results in order to understand sensor mechanics. Using a differential measurement approach, a handmade prototype provided linear sensory behavior and 0.2 mm accuracy on two-DOF. This correlates to a 0.7\% error over the sensor's 30 mm × 30 mm planar range, demonstrating the outstanding potential of DE technology for accurate multiDOF position sensing.},

An actuator with multiple gear ratios, like in a powertrain, can address this issue by allowing an effective use of power over a wide range of output speed. However, having discrete modes of operation adds complexity to the high-level control and planning. Here a controller for two-speed actuators that automatically select both the best gear ratio and the motor torque is developed. The approach is to: first derive a low-dimensional model, then use dynamic programming to find the best actions for all possible situations, and last use regression analysis to extract simplified global feedback laws. This approach produces simple practical nearly-optimal feedback laws. A controller that globally minimizes a quadratic cost function is derived for a two-speed actuator prototype, global stability is proven and performance is demonstrated experimentally.},

Independent state variables are augmented by adding auxiliary variables that are needed for describing constitutive laws of individual system components, which may be nonlinear. The augmented space is then reduced to a minimum dimensional space through latent variable analysis of the data created with simulation of the original nonlinear dynamic equations. Based on Bond-Graph model of a dynamical system, the minimum-order of the augmented latent space that can completely recover all the original data points is obtained. A method for further truncating the latent variables for real-time computation is also obtained. Numerical simulations demonstrate that the proposed method can produce the precise linearization of a nonlinear system, strikingly different from the standard linear approximation using Taylor expansion.},

By controlling the relative motion of gears in the hybrid control module, position and stiffness can be simultaneously controlled for the same joint. The HDAU provides a wide range of joint stiffness due to nonlinearity obtained from the adjustable moment arm. The joint stiffness can be kept constant independent of the passive deflection angle of the output shaft. Furthermore, stable interaction can also be achieved because the joint stiffness is indirectly adjusted by position control of the hybrid control module. The characteristics of the HDAU are analyzed in this study. We show by experiment that the HDAU can provide a wide range of stiffness variation and rapid response for stiffness change.},

	abstract = {Novel compliant actuation systems have been developed in recent years for a variety of possible advantages, such as establishing a safe human–robot interaction, increasing energy efficiency, reducing the effects of impacts and even for the development of neuro-inspired robotic platforms to be used in human motor control studies.

In this rapidly growing and transversal research field, systems involving more than one active element (typically motors) for each actuated degree of freedom are being investigated to allow separate position and impedance regulations. Considering the wide range of applications and the large number of different arrangements deriving from the combination of two active elements and passive elastic components, several actuation architectures have been devised.

This paper reviews state-of-the-art rotary variable impedance units incorporating two separate motors. Existing devices are grouped in three main categories. A critical and comparative analysis of the most relevant features is carried out, also based on most representative prototypes. Recently proposed methodologies and evaluation criteria for design optimization are illustrated and perspectives on potential applications of double actuation systems are presented.},

	abstract = {The theory of reinforcement learning provides a normative account, deeply rooted in psychological and neuroscientific perspectives on animal behaviour, of how agents may optimize their control of an environment. To use reinforcement learning successfully in situations approaching real-world complexity, however, agents are confronted with a difficult task: they must derive efficient representations of the environment from high-dimensional sensory inputs, and use these to generalize past experience to new situations. Remarkably, humans and other animals seem to solve this problem through a harmonious combination of reinforcement learning and hierarchical sensory processing systems, the former evidenced by a wealth of neural data revealing notable parallels between the phasic signals emitted by dopaminergic neurons and temporal difference reinforcement learning algorithms. While reinforcement learning agents have achieved some successes in a variety of domains, their applicability has previously been limited to domains in which useful features can be handcrafted, or to domains with fully observed, low-dimensional state spaces. Here we use recent advances in training deep neural networks to develop a novel artificial agent, termed a deep Q-network, that can learn successful policies directly from high-dimensional sensory inputs using end-to-end reinforcement learning. We tested this agent on the challenging domain of classic Atari 2600 games. We demonstrate that the deep Q-network agent, receiving only the pixels and the game score as inputs, was able to surpass the performance of all previous algorithms and achieve a level comparable to that of a professional human games tester across a set of 49 games, using the same algorithm, network architecture and hyperparameters. This work bridges the divide between high-dimensional sensory inputs and actions, resulting in the first artificial agent that is capable of learning to excel at a diverse array of challenging tasks.},

A probability-based estimation of the relevance is suggested by first projecting the motion data onto a generic latent space using principal component analysis. The resulting signals are encoded using a mixture of Gaussian/Bernoulli distributions (Gaussian mixture model/Bernoulli mixture model). This provides a measure of the spatio-temporal correlations across the different modalities collected from the robot, which can be used to determine a metric of the imitation performance. The trajectories are then generalized using Gaussian mixture regression.

	abstract = {Solving an optimal control or estimation problem is not easy. Pieces of the puzzle are found scattered throughout many different disciplines. Furthermore, the focus of this book is on practical methods, that is, methods that I have found actually work! In fact everything described in this book has been implemented in production software and used to solve real optimal control problems. Although the reader should be proficient in advanced mathematics, no theorems are presented. Traditionally, there are two major parts of a successful optimal control or optimal estimation solution technique. The first part is the “optimization” method. The second part is the “differential equation” method. When faced with an optimal control or estimation problem it is tempting to simply “paste” together packages for optimization and numerical integration. While naive approaches such as this may be moderately successful, the goal of this book is to suggest that there is a better way! The methods used to solve the differential equations and optimize the functions are intimately related. The first two chapters of this book focus on the optimization part of the problem. In Chapter 1 the important concepts of nonlinear programming for small dense applications are introduced. Chapter 2 extends the presentation to problems which are both large and sparse. Chapters 3 and 4 address the differential equation part of the problem. Chapter 3 introduces relevant material in the numerical solution of differential (and differentialalgebraic) equations. Methods for solving the optimal control problem are treated in some detail in Chapter 4. Throughout the book the interaction between optimization and integration is emphasized. Chapter 5 describes how to solve optimal estimation problems. Chapter 6 presents a collection of examples that illustrate the various concepts and techniques. Real world problems often require solving a sequence of optimal control and/or optimization problems, and Chapter 7 describes a collection of these “advanced applications.” While the book incorporates a great deal of new material not covered in Practical Methods for Optimal Control Using Nonlinear Programming [21], it does not cover everything. Many important topics are simply not discussed in order to keep the overall presentation concise and focused. The discussion is general and presents a unified approach to solving optimal estimation and control problems. Most of the examples are drawn from my experience in the aerospace industry. Examples have been solved using a particular implementation called  SOCS.{\textless}math display="inline" overflow="scroll"{\textgreater} {\textless}mrow{\textgreater}{\textless}mi mathvariant="double-struck"{\textgreater}SOCS{\textless}/mi{\textgreater}{\textless}mo{\textgreater}.{\textless}/mo{\textgreater}{\textless}/mrow{\textgreater} {\textless}/math{\textgreater}  I have tried to adhere to notational conventions from both optimization and control theory whenever possible.

For such problems, we need to seek both the optimal switching instants and the optimal continuous inputs. In order to search for the optimal switching instants, the derivatives of the optimal cost with respect to the switching instants need to be known. The most important contribution of the paper is a method which first transcribes an optimal control problem into an equivalent problem parameterized by the switching instants and then obtains the values of the derivatives based on the solution of a two point boundary value differential algebraic equation formed by the state, costate, stationarity equations, the boundary and continuity conditions, along with their differentiations. This method is applied to general switched linear quadratic problems and an efficient method based on the solution of an initial value ordinary differential equation is developed. An extension of the method is also applied to problems with internally forced switching. Examples are shown to illustrate the results in the paper.},

The estimated impulse response is used in a norm-optimal iterative learning controller, where actuator limitations can be formulated as linear inequality constraints. Experimental validation on a linear motor positioning system shows the ability of the proposed data-driven framework to: 1) achieve tracking accuracy up to the repeatability of the test setup; 2) minimize the rms value of the tracking error while respecting the actuator input constraints; 3) learn energy-optimal system inputs for point-to-point motions.},

	abstract = {In contrast to common rigid or actively compliant systems, Variable Stiffness Arms are capable of storing potential energy in their joint and convert it into kinetic energy, respectively speed. This capability is well known from humans and is a good example for the outstanding performance of biological systems. However, only since some years intrinsic compliance is considered as a key feature and not a drawback in robot design. Therefore, only very little work has been carried out on exploiting the natural dynamics of elastic arms for such explosive motion sequences. In this paper, we treat the problem of how to optimally achieve maximum link velocity at a given final time for Variable Stiffness Arms. We show that solutions to this problem lead to excitation motions, which enable the robot to move on the link side at much higher speed than on the motor side. In particular, the robot uses the dynamic transfer of elastic joint energy into link side kinetic energy for further acceleration. In our work we consider the practically relevant input and state constraints, and give experimental verification of the developed methods on the new DLR Hand-Arm system.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we address the problem of agile swing-free trajectory tracking of a quadrotor with a suspended load. This problem has great practical significance in many UAV applications. However, it has received little attention in the literature so far. Flying with a suspended load can be a very challenging and sometimes hazardous task as the suspended load significantly alters the flight characteristics of the quadrotor. In order to deal with this problem, we propose a technique based on dynamic programming which ensures swing-free trajectory tracking. We start by presenting the mathematical model of a quadrotor with suspended load dynamics and kinematics. A high-level planner is used to provide desired waypoints, and then a dynamic programming approach is used to generate the swing-free trajectory for the quadrotor carrying a suspended load. Effectiveness of this method is demonstrated by numerical simulations and experiments.},

Variable-impedance actuators, used to drive many of these devices, are capable of modulating torque and impedance (stiffness and/or damping) simultaneously, continuously, and independently. These actuators are, however, nonlinear and assert numerous constraints, e.g., range, rate, and effort limits on the dynamics. Finding a control strategy that makes use of the intrinsic dynamics and capacity of compliant actuators for such redundant, nonlinear, and constrained systems is nontrivial. In this study, we propose a framework for optimization of torque and impedance profiles in order to maximize task performance, which is tuned to the complex hardware and incorporating real-world actuation constraints. Simulation study and hardware experiments 1) demonstrate the effects of actuation constraints during impedance control, 2) show applicability of the present framework to simultaneous torque and temporal stiffness optimization under constraints that are imposed by real-world actuators, and 3) validate the benefits of the proposed approach under experimental conditions.},

	abstract = {In this study, we consider the control problem of a hybrid actuation system that is composed of more than two different types of actuators. Even though actuators are one crucial component for developing a robot with many degrees of freedom, such as humanoid and exoskeleton robots, technical difficulties and costs complicate the development of new actuators. On the other hand, since different types of actuators provide various strengths and weaknesses, an efficient approach will probably combine different types of actuators to design a novel actuation system. The crucial issue for such a hybrid actuator is a method that distributes the necessary torque/force to different actuators for generating target movements. We propose using an optimal control method to find the torque distribution strategy for hybrid actuators. We consider an optimal torque distribution method for a pneumatic-electric (P-E) hybrid actuator model that is used in our newly developed exoskeleton robot XoR. We present a control approach with a trajectory-based optimal control method with minimum energy criterion. Focusing on the robot's ankle joint, we apply our control method in numerical simulations and demonstrate that it reasonably finds the optimal torque distribution strategy based on the nature of the given task, and the results of high control performance.},

ROCR, pronounced “Rocker,” is a pendular, two-link, serial-chain robot that utilizes alternating handholds and an actuated tail to propel itself upward in a climbing style based on observation of human climbers and brachiating gibbons. ROCR's bioinspired pendular climbing strategy is simple and efficient. In fact, to our knowledge, ROCR is also the first climbing robot that is designed for efficiency. ROCR is a lightweight, flexible, and self-contained robot. This robot is intended for autonomous surveillance and inspection on sheer vertical surfaces. Potential locomotion gait strategies were investigated in simulation using Working Model 2D, and were evaluated on a basis of climbing rate, energy efficiency, and whether stable open-loop climbing was achieved. We identified that the most effective climbing resulted from sinusoidal tail motions. The addition of a body stabilizer reduced the robot's out-of-plane motion at higher frequencies and promoted more reliable gripper attachment. Experimental measurements of the robot showed climbing efficiencies of over 20\% and a specific resistance of 5.0, while consuming 27 J/m at a maximum climbing speed of 15.7 cm/s (0.34 body lengths/s) - setting a first benchmark for efficiency of climbing robots. Future work will include further design optimization, integration of more complex gripping mechanisms, and investigating more complex control strategies.},

Unlike conventional reconfigurable robots, our design does not achieve reconfigurability by utilizing modular joints. Rather, the robot is equipped with passive joints, i.e., joints without actuator or sensor, which permit changing the Denavit-Hartenberg (DH) parameters such as the link length and twist angle. The passive joints will become controllable when the robot forms a closed kinematic chain. Also, each passive joint is equipped with a built-in brake mechanism that is normally locked, but the lock can be released whenever the parameters are to be changed. Such a versatile and agile robot is particularly suitable for space application for its simple, compact, and light design. The kinematics and recalibration of this kind of reconfigurable robot are thoroughly analyzed. A stable reconfiguration-control algorithm is devised to take the robot from one configuration to another by directly regulating the passive joints to the associated, desired DH parameters. Conditions for the observability and the controllability of the passive joints are also derived in detail.},

We then review disjunctive branch and bound as well as logic-based decomposition methods that circumvent some of the limitations in traditional MINLP optimization. We next consider the case of linear GDP problems to show how a hierarchy of relaxations can be developed by performing sequential intersection of disjunctions. Finally, for the case when the GDP problem involves nonconvex functions, we propose a scheme for tightening the lower bounds for obtaining the global optimum using a combined disjunctive and spatial branch and bound search.

The model captures the identified phenomena, subsumes previous models, yet retains enough structure to pose and solve meaningful control problems. We develop a theory for synthesizing hybrid controllers for hybrid plants in all optimal control framework. In particular, we demonstrate the existence of optimal (relaxed) and near-optimal (precise) controls and derive “generalized quasi-variational inequalities” that the associated value function satisfies. We summarize algorithms for solving these inequalities based on a generalized Bellman equation, impulse control, and linear programming},

The most complicated of these models has 5 links (a body and two arms, each with 2 links) and 7 degrees of freedom in flight. The defining feature of all our periodic solutions is that all collisions are at zero relative velocity. These motions are found using numerical integration and root-finding that is sufficiently precise so as to imply that the solutions found correspond to mathematical solutions with exactly zero energy cost. The only actuation and control in the model is for maintaining contact with and releasing handholds which requires no mechanical work. The similarity of these energy-free simulations to the motions of apes suggests that muscle-use minimization at least partially characterizes the coordination strategies they use.},

This paper presents an analytical model for the simulation, analysis and control of shift dynamics for DCT vehicles. A dynamic model and the control logic for the integrated vehicle have been developed using Matlab/Simulink as the simulation platform. The model has been used to study the variation in output torque in response to different clutch pressure profiles during shifts. Optimized clutch pressure profiles have been created for the best possible shift quality based on model simulation. As a numerical example, the model is used for a DCT vehicle to simulate the wide-open throttle performance.

The design principle of a leg called a gravitationally decoupled actuator (GDA) is shown to be indispensable for realizing energetically efficient walking mo tion. A novel mechanism, the three-dimensional Cartesian- coordinate pantograph (PANTOMEC), which follows the GDA principle and has a lightweight structure, is introduced. A constructed quadruped walking vehicle model is then de scribed : the walking vehicle has the PANTOMEC leg mecha nisms, eight tactile sensors and a posture detector, and is hierarchically controlled by a microcomputer. Comparatively high energy efficiency and a certain degree of terrain adapt ability is demonstrated. It is thus shown that a practical walking vehicle can be designed using the proposed method.
The adaptive gait control problem is formalized, and an algorithm for terrain-adaptive gait control is presented. By computer simulation, it is shown that the algorithm produces an efficient gait while avoiding "deadlock" positions in nego tiating terrain. The algorithm is shown to be applicable for the control of future quadruped walking vehicles with visual sensors.},

We present a design framework that employs dynamic couplings in the form of brakes and clutches to increase the performance and diversity of linear actuators. The couplings are used to switch between a diverse range of discrete modes of operation within a single actuator. We also provide a design solution for miniaturized couplings that use dry friction to produce rapid switching and high braking forces. The couplings are designed so that once engaged or disengaged no extra energy is consumed. We apply the design framework and coupling design to a linear series elastic actuator (SEA) and show that this relatively simple implementation increases the performance and adds new behaviours to the standard design. Through a number of performance tests we are able to show rapid switching between a high and a low impedance output mode; that the actuator's spring can be charged to produce short bursts of high output power; and that the actuator has additional passive and rigid modes that consume no power once activated. Robots using actuators from this design framework would see a vast increase in their behavioural diversity and improvements in their performance not yet possible with conventional actuator design.},

As a trade-off, reducing interface stiffness also lowers zero motion force bandwidth. In this paper, the authors propose that for natural tasks, zero motion force bandwidth isn't everything, and incorporating series elasticity as a purposeful element within the actuator is a good idea. The authors use the term elasticity instead of compliance to indicate the presence of a passive mechanical spring in the actuator. After a discussion of the trade-offs inherent in series elastic actuators, the authors present a control system for their use under general force or impedance control.

In this system, the micro-actuator is capable of high-bandwidth force control owing to its low mass and direct-drive connection to the output shaft. The compliant transmission of the macro-actuator reduces the impedance (stiffness) at the output shaft, and increases the dynamic range of force. Performance improvement over single- actuator systems was expected in force control, impedance control, force distortion, and transient impact force reduction.
Several theoretical performance limits are derived from the sat uration limits of the system. A control law is presented. A prototype test bed was built and an experimental comparison was performed between this actuator concept and two single-actuator systems.
A set of quantitative measures is proposed and the actuator system is evaluated against them with the following results: force bandwidth of 56 Hz, torque dynamic range of 800: 1, peak torque of 1,040 mNm, and minimum torque of 1.3 mNm. Peak impactforce, fonce distortion, and back-driven impedance of the PaCMMA system are shown to be better than either of the single-actuator configurations considered.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the design concept of a new robot based on the direct-drive method using rare-earth d-c torque motors. Because these motors have high torque, light weight and compact size, we can construct robots with far better performance than those presently available. For example, we can eliminate all the transmission mechanisms, such as reducers and chain belts, between the motors and their loads, and construct a simple mechanism (direct-drive) where the arm links are directly coupled to the motor rotors. This elimination can lead to excellent performance: no backlash, low friction, low inertia, low compliance and high reliability, all of which are suited for high-speed, high-precision robots. First we propose a basic configuration of direct-drive robots. Second a general procedure for designing direct-drive robots is shown, and the feasibility of direct drive for robot actuation is discussed in terms of weights and torques of joints. One of the difficulties in designing direct-drive robots is that motors to drive wrist joints are loads for motors to drive elbow joints, and they are loads for motors at shoulders. To reduce this increasing series of loads is an essential issue for designing practical robots. We analyze the joint mass system for simplified kinematic model of the direct-drive robots, and show how the loads are reduced significantly by using rare-earth motors with light-weight and high torque. We also discuss optimum kinematic structures with minimum arm weight. Finally, we describe the direct-drive robotic manipulator (CMU arm) developed at Carnegie-Mellon University, and verify the design theory.},

	abstract = {Control of a robot manipulator in contact with the environment is usually conducted by the direct feedback control system using a force-torque sensor or the indirect impedance control scheme. Although these methods have been successfully applied to many applications, simultaneous control of force and position cannot be achieved. Furthermore, collision safety has been of primary concern in recent years with emergence of service robots in direct contact with humans. To cope with such problems, redundant actuation has been used to enhance the performance of a position/force controller. In this paper, the novel design of a double actuator unit (DAU) composed of double actuators and a planetary gear train is proposed to provide the capability of simultaneous control of position and force as well as the improved collision safety. Since one actuator controls position and the other actuator modulates stiffness, DAU can control the position and stiffness simultaneously at the same joint. The torque exerted on the joint can be estimated without an expensive torque/force sensor. DAU is capable of detecting dynamic collision by monitoring the speed of the stiffness modulator. Upon detection of dynamic collision, DAU immediately reduces its joint stiffness according to the collision magnitude, thus providing the optimum collision safety. It is shown from various experiments that DAU can provide good performance of position tracking, force estimation and collision safety.},

We propose four design principles that minimize these losses: employment of high torque density motors, low impedance transmission, energy regenerative electronics and a design architecture that minimizes the leg inertia. We present the design features of the MIT cheetah robot as an embodiment of these principles. The resulting cost of transport (COT) is 0.51 during 2.3 m/s running, which rivals running animals in the same scale.},

	abstract = {Direct drive is an ideal drive method which has excellent features including no backlash, low friction, and high mechanical stiffness. Applying the direct drive method to robot arms, however, leads to an impractical design because of the following two drawbacks. One is that a direct-drive arm tends to be heavier than a conventional arm with transmission mechanisms; because the motors of direct-drive arm are located at each joint of the arm the weight of each motor is a load to the previous motors down the serial linkage of the arm. Another problem is insufficient drive torques due to the elimination of gears which amplify the motor torques. This paper describes a lightweight arm mechanism for the direct-drive robots. The major improvements are: (1) the serial link mechanism is replaced by a four-bar-link mechanism in order to avoid the mounting of heavy motors at the serial links, (2) high performance brushless motors have been developed so that large torques can be obtained with relatively small power dissipation. Throughout the basic analysis and experiments, the arm which has been developed is evaluated in terms of efficiency, load capacity and dynamic response.},

	doi = {10.1109/VPPC.2009.5289707},
	abstract = {The current level of interest in electric vehicles (EVs) could hardly be overstated as manufacturers and governments around the world appear to have increased interest at a staggering rate. The resurgence of current interest in the early part of the 21st century has been driven by both political and technological developments, namely a requirement to control global emissions and the emergence of new battery designs with improved specific energy, energy density and rechargability properties. One of the great advantages of the electric motor is its torque characteristic which provides maximum torque from zero up to low speeds, and then it is governed by the maximum power available as motor speed increase. This has two significant advantages over the typical torque-speed properties of the competing IC engine: (1) It is fundamentally a more desirable characteristic spread of torque over the speed range in contrast to the peakiness of an IC engine. (2) It removes the need for any additional transmission clutch or gears. However, one of the main conclusions to emerge from the plethora of research work into energy efficient vehicles is that it is necessary to pursue every possible avenue for minor efficiency gains. It is therefore of interest to investigate whether it is possible to manage the efficiency of the electric motor, so that by using an intermediate gearbox the motor is operated more often in its higher efficiency region. The aim of this paper is to develop a simple EV model and predict its energy consumption with a variable and fixed ratio gearbox over a standard driving cycle in order to understand whether this could offer significant efficiency gains. The emerging conclusions are that it is possible to improve overall energy consumption levels by around 5 to 12\% with a variable ratio gearbox depending on the driving cycle used. However, there are many other practical considerations which must be weighed against this positive result and the paper discusses the - impact of several of these such as, gearbox efficiency, additional weight, cost and complexity, effect on drivability and potential for motor downsizing.},

	abstract = {The electric vehicle is becoming increasingly prevalent as a viable option to replace hydrocarbon fuelled vehicles, and as such the development of high efficiency fully electric drivetrains is a particularly relevant research topic. The drivetrain topology is one of the main focuses of research on fully electric drivetrains, because of the variety of available options. For example, the adoption of multiple-speed mechanical transmissions can improve both the performance and energy consumption when compared to a single-speed transmission. A four-speed, dual motor drivetrain design is presented in this article which works on the principle of two double-speed transmissions, each driven by a separate motor linked through a sole secondary shaft. This drivetrain architecture provides increased flexibility of the electric motor operating points, theoretically being beneficial to the overall efficiency of the system for any driving condition. This paper presents the design of the transmission, its governing equations and the method adopted to optimize the state selection map and electric motor torque distribution. A backward-facing energy consumption model is used to compare the results of the four-speed transmission with those of single- and double-speed transmissions for four case study vehicles. © 2012 IEEE.},

The three gear ratios of a transmission system can maintain the motor speed within a stable region with relatively high energy efficiency, while various vehicle speeds are needed. This work is based on a light EV prototype.

	abstract = {We present the Supernumerary Robotic Limbs (SRL), a wearable robot designed to assist human workers with additional arms and legs attached to the wearer's body. The SRL can work closely with the wearer by holding an object, positioning a workpiece, operating a powered tool, securing the human body, and more. Although the SRL has the potential to provide the wearer with greater strength, higher accuracy, flexibility, and dexterity, its control performance is hindered by unpredictable disturbances due to involuntary motions of the wearer, which include postural sway and physiological tremor. This paper presents 1) a Kalman filter approach to estimate the state of the SRL despite the involuntary wearer's motion, and 2) a method for improving the accuracy and stabilizing the human body and the SRL. The dynamics of the human-SRL system are analyzed, including human-induced disturbance models based on biomechanics literature. A discrete Kalman filter is constructed and its performance is evaluated in terms of error covariance. A “bracing” technique is then introduced to suppress the human-induced disturbances; one robotic limb grasps an environment structure and uses it as a support to attenuate the disturbances. We show how bracing can be used to shape the stiffness parameters at the robot base. This in turn allows to enhance state estimation accuracy in the areas of the workspace where the user needs assistance.},

A necessary and sufficient condition to ensure the stability of a linear manipulator coupled at a single interaction port to a linear, passive environment is found. It is shown that this condition may be extended to a broad class of active environments, and a simple test for coupled stability, based on the root locus, is presented. Two interaction controller designs for a linear manipulator are presented. Interactive behaviour is analysed in the frequency domain by comparison with the behaviour of a target model. A simple controller shows strong stability properties, but poor behaviour; a more sophisticated design shows that it is possible to achieve desirable behaviour while retaining stability guarantees.},

The experimental results show the significant improvement that can be achieved with hybrid actuation over an actuation system with pneumatic artificial muscles alone.

	abstract = {This thesis presents a new actuator system  consisting of a micro-actuator and a macro-actuator coupled in parallel via a compliant  transmission. The system is called the  Parallel Coupled Micro-Macro Actuator, or  PaCMMA. In this system, the micro-actuator is  capable of high bandwidth force control due to  its low mass and direct-drive connection to  the output shaft. The compliant transmission  of the macro-actuator reduces the impedance  (stiffness) at the output shaft and increases  the dynamic range of force. Performance  improvement over single actuator systems  was expected in force control, impedance  control, force distortion and reduction of  transient impact forces. A set of quantitative  measures is proposed and the actuator  system is evaluated against them: Force  Control Bandwidth, Position Bandwidth,  Dynamic Range, Impact Force, Impedance  ("Backdriveability'"), Force Distortion and  Force Performance Space. Several theoretical  performance limits are derived from the  saturation limits of the system. A control law is  proposed and control system performance is  compared to the theoretical limits. A prototype  testbed was built using permanenent magnet  motors and an experimental comparison was  performed between this actuator concept and  two single actuator systems. The following  performance was observed: Force bandwidth  of 56Hz, Torque Dynamic Range of 800:1,  Peak Torque of 1040mNm, Minimum Torque  of 1.3mNm. Peak Impact Force was reduced  by an order of magnitude. Distortion at small  amplitudes was reduced substantially.  Backdriven impedance was reduced by 2-3  orders of magnitude. This actuator system  shows promise for manipulator design as  well as psychophysical tests of human  performance.},

The vertical stiffness controlled leg was tested on a material testing device to calibrate the mechanical impedance of the leg. By compensating transmission impedance from commanded torque, the leg was able to estimate impact force. For the impact test, the mean absolute error as a ratio of full scale sensor force is 0.041 in the 3406 N/m stiffness experiment and is 0.049 in the 5038 N/m experiment.

To cope with such problems, this paper proposes a novel design of a dual actuator unit (DAU) composed of two actuators and a planetary gear train to provide the capability of simultaneous control of position and stiffness. Since one actuator controls position and the other actuator modulates stiffness, the DAU can control the position and stiffness simultaneously at the same joint. Both the torque exerted on the joint and the stiffness of the environment can be estimated without an expensive force sensor. Various experiments demonstrate that the DAU can provide good performance for position tracking, force estimation, and environment estimation.},

Thereby, the synchronization of the gear box is formulated as a constraint at the end of the process. A control law is derived analytically in an explicit form by minimizing the performance measure over each process stage. Simulation results show a significant improvement in terms of gear shift comfort by different driving load cases.

	abstract = {Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) compatible robots can assist physicians with the insertion of biopsy needles and needle-like therapeutic instruments directly into millimeter-size tumors, using MR images as feedback. However, MRI systems present a challenging environment with high magnetic fields and limited space, making the development of MRI-compatible robots complex. This paper presents an MRI-compatible pneumatic actuation technology consisting of molded polymer structures with embedded air-muscles operated in a binary fashion. Along with its good positioning accuracy, the technology presents advantages of compactness, perfect MRI-compatibility, simplicity and low cost. Here, we specifically report the design and validation of a transperineal prostate cancer manipulator prototype that has 20 embedded air-muscles distributed in four star-like polymer structures. These compliant structures are made of silicone elastomer, using lost-core injection molding. Low motion hysteresis and good precision are achieved by designing molded joints that eliminate sliding surfaces. An effective design method for such embedded polymer air-muscles is proposed, using a manipulator model and four air-muscle design models: geometrical, finite elements, uniaxial analytic, and experimental. Binary control of each air-muscle ensures stability and accuracy with minimized costs and complexity. The prototype is found MRI-compatible with no observable effects on the signal-to-noise ratio and, with appropriate image feedback, is found to reach targets with precision and accuracy under 0.5 mm. The embedded approach reveals to be a key feature since it reduces hysteresis errors by a factor of ≈7 compared to a previous nonembedded version of the manipulator. The successful validation of this binary manipulator opens the door to a new design paradigm for low cost and highly capable pneumatic robots.},

	abstract = {Fundamental studies of Dielectric Elastomer Actuators (DEAs) using viscoelastic materials such as VHB 4905/4910 from 3M showed significant advantages at high stretch rates. The film's viscous forces increase actuator life and the short power-on times minimize energy losses through current leakage. This paper presents a design paradigm that exploits these fundamental properties of DEAs called discrete actuation. Discrete actuation uses DEAs at high stretch rates to change the states of robotic or mechatronic systems in discrete steps. Each state of the system is stable and can be maintained without actuator power. Discrete actuation can be used in robotic and mechatronic applications such as manipulation and locomotion. The resolution of such systems increases with the number of discrete states, 10 to 100 being sufficient for many applications. An MRI-guided needle positioning device for cancer treatments and a space exploration robot using hopping for locomotion are presented as examples of this concept.},
