In many applications, robots have to bear large loads while moving slowly and also have to move quickly through the air with almost no load. These conflicting requirements often lead to the use of oversized and inefficient actuators, which are inhibitory, particularly for mobile robots. Multiple gear ratios, like in a power train, address this issue by allowing an effective use of power over a wide range of output speeds, and by making possible the leveraging or attenuation of the natural load dynamics. This thesis aims to develop the technological solutions needed to use variable gear ratio actuators and exploit their advantages in a robotic context. First, by addressing the issue of how to make fast and seamless gearshifts between two very different gear ratios under diverse load conditions, with a solution based on a dual-motor actuator architecture and a control scheme using the null-space. Second, by developing control algorithms that select dynamically gear ratios based on state feedback, to move with minimal motor torques and to adjust the output impedance appropriately given a task. Simulations and experiments using a novel lightweight robotic arm using three custom-built dual-speed dual-motor actuators are presented and demonstrate the advantage of the approach. 


%Finally, the advantages of the approach are illustrated with a legged locomotion case-study, where a leg must move quickly in the air, manage an impact with the ground and then bear a large load.
