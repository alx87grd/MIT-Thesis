\section*{Acknowledgments}

I would like to thank everyone that supported me, directly or indirectly, through my studies at MIT. 

First I would like to thank my thesis advisor, Professor Asada, who gave me the opportunity to work on unique robotic research projects in the d'Arbeloff laboratory. His guidance was invaluable, always thinking ahead to guide my efforts in a direction that would generate innovative and relevant research. I hope to have learn some of his wisdom during my years at MIT. Also special thanks to Professor Hogan and Professor Slotine for been member of my thesis committee. Their advises and constant challenges were appreciated and contributed to make my thesis stronger.

I would also like to thank the whole MIT community, for being a constant source of inspiration. The education I have received during my PhD was of outstanding quality. I learned a lot spending time with members of MechE and CSAIL community.

Special thanks to The Boeing Compagny, Sumitomo Heavy Industry, \textit{Le Fond Quebecois de Recherche sur la Nature et Technologie} and The Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada that contributed to funding my PhD studies.
