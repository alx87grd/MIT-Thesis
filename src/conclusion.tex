This thesis explored the idea of robotic systems using actuators with transmission gear-ratios that can be dynamically changed online. Although variable transmissions are used extensively in vehicle power-trains, this concept is highly under-explored and under-exploited in the field of robotics, despite huge potential gains as demonstrated in this thesis. Variable gear-ratios actuators can be used not merely for increasing maximum torque and speed, but also to significantly advantageously alter the dynamic properties of robots including load sensitivity, robustness and back-drivability. This thesis main contributions are DSDM actuators, a solution to make gear-shift processes adapted to a wide range of robotic tasks, and generic approaches to synthesized closed-loop gear-ratios selection policies for a class of robotic systems using variable transmission.

%
Chapter \ref{sec:VisionForAircraftManufacturingAutomation} briefly discussed manufacturing applications, where actuators must meet challenging requirements, that could hugely benefit from the proposed technologies developed in this thesis. 
%
Chapter \ref{sec:MultipleSpeedActuationTechnology} presented the DSDM actuation technology that can change its effective gear-ratio, between a small reduction and a very large reduction, quickly and seamlessly even in highly dynamic situations. 
%
Chapter \ref{sec:ControlAndPlanningOfRobotUsingVariableGearRatioActuators} explored the idea of closed-loop selection of gear-ratios for multi-DoF robotic systems, and proposed multiple effective control schemes.
%
Chapter \ref{sec:ExperimentalValidation} presented the DSDM-Arm, a novel lightweight robotic system using three DSDM actuators, that was used for experimental validation of all the proposed control schemes. %The DSDM-Arm mechanical design, control implementation and specifications were discussed. 


The author would like encourage all researchers in the field of robotics, to question the single-gear-electric-motor actuation paradigm, and envisioning variable transmissions for applications that require speed and force in a small package. The field is appealing from both an engineering and a scientific perspective. On one hand, it is a very practical solution to relevant power-transmission problems: cars, bicycles, electric drills, etc, use multiple speed transmissions. On the other hand, it makes the problem of controlling non-linear robotic systems: even more non-linear and hybrid. Exciting research questions are raised that are both challenging and worth solving, and the author hopes you joint him in visiting this realm where there be dragons.
