This chapter illustrates robotic concepts to automate the manufacturing of large objects, such as airplanes, ships, buildings, etc. For those types of manufacturing tasks, unlike car production where the part can be on an assembly line and surrounded by robots, robots must be able to go inside the large manufactured object. %Additionally, with typically slower rates of production and larger numbers of distinct required operations, 


\section{Current situation}
\label{sec:CurrentSituation}

Here, the current manufacturing approach and the challenge for automating the manufacturing and assembly of aircraft is briefly explored.


\section{Solution Concepts}

Here, three class of possible solution are presented.




\subsection{Mobile climbing robots}
\label{sec:MobileClimbingRobots}

Another approach, aiming at a higher level of automation, is to have mobile robots walking or climbing inside the aircraft fuselage to reach manufacturing sites automatically.

\subsection{Wearable robots}
\label{sec:WearableRobots}

One possible solution, to solve bring robot on site easily is to use the help of humans, which unlike robot would have no problems navigating and moving inside a manufacturing site.

\subsection{Light-weight long manipulator arms}
\label{sec:LightWeightLongManipulatorArm}

Alternatively, robotic arm that would be very long and articulated could be able to reach manufacturing sites from the outside of the fuselage.
